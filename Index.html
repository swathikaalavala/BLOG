<h4>About AI</h4>
<p>Artificial intelligence is a constellation of many different technologies working together to enable machines to sense, comprehend, act, and learn with human-like levels of intelligence. Maybe that's why it seems as though everyone's definition of artificial intelligence is different: AI isn't just one thing.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been transforming industries and reshaping our daily lives, becoming one of the most exciting technological developments of our time. From self-driving cars and personalized recommendations to smart assistants like Siri and Alexa, AI has moved from science fiction to practical, everyday reality. But as this technology evolves, it presents both tremendous opportunities and challenges across various sectors.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence technology is used for a wide range of applications, including in web development, such as automated chatbots for customer service, product recommendations based on a user’s habits, speech recognition, and even to build a website from scratch. Essentially, the purpose of AI is to improve the systems we already use by automating tasks to make them more efficient.</p>

    <h4>Brief on AI technology</h4>
    <p><h4>AI systems process large amounts of data through algorithms in order to find patterns that will help them understand and replicate <br>
        human intelligence by predicting future behavior from an end-user. For example, when using an AI-powered chatbot, the system will work <br>
        to preempt a user’s next question by offering information as a real chat agent would.

    <h4>First humaniod AI robot</h4>
    <h4><p>Sophia is a humanoid robot that can interact with people and display human-like expressions. <br>
        She was developed by Hanson Robotics, a Hong Kong-based company, and is designed for research,<br> 
        education, and entertainment.Some of the things Sophia can do include: </p></h4>
    <p>
        Recognize faces and hold eye contact:  Sophia's AI and neural network architecture allow her to do this.<br></p>
    <p> Understand human speech:  Sophia's AI and neural network architecture allow her to do this.<br></p>
    <p>Pick up and respond to key words and phrases:  Sophia's Sophisticated Chat System allows her to do this.<br></p>
    <p> Express feelings:  Sophia can let you know if she is angry or upset.<br></p>
    <h3>Achievements through AI</h3>

<h4>Common examples of AI applications</h4>
<h5>1.Education</h5> 
<p>AI is used in all levels of education to make a teacher’s life simpler and improve the experience of students in a classroom.
     AI programs are currently helping teachers grade students’ work, which is normally very time-consuming. It also allows for 
     a more personalized learning experience for students. Programs like Carnegie Learning use AI to offer students feedback on 
     their work as well as personalized testing and learning.</p>
<h5>2.Health care</h5>
<p>In the field of healthcare, AI is being used in order to help monitor, diagnose, and treat patients. Since AI today is able to 
    adapt based on the data it learns, the more it learns about different patients, the better it develops into an essential tool.
     Programs such as IBM Watson Health allow medical staff to ask questions in natural language and get a response, which helps
      doctors optimize their performance.
</p>
<h5>3.Chatbots</h5>
<p>Chatbots are used in many customer service teams to help filter the number of users who interact with real customer service agents
     and provide more immediate answers. These chatbots use an AI that is able to answer basic questions based on certain keywords a 
     customer types in. Some of them are even able to offer near-human-level customer service, while others simply help direct customers
     to the right department or human service agent.</p>

<h3>Future of AI</h3>
<p>AI is still in its early stages, and its full potential is yet to be realized. Advancements in areas like quantum computing, machine learning, and natural language processing will only accelerate its impact. However, as AI continues to develop, society must address the accompanying ethical, social, and economic challenges.
    AI holds the promise of solving some of the world’s most complex problems, from climate change to healthcare disparities. But its benefits must be balanced with responsible development and governance to ensure that AI serves the greater good.

<h3>History of AI</h3>
<p>The late 19th and early 20th centuries brought forth foundational work that would give rise to the modern computer. In 1836, 
    Cambridge University mathematician Charles Babbage and Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, invented the first design for 
    a programmable machine, known as the Analytical Engine. Babbage outlined the design for the first mechanical computer, while 
    Lovelace -- often considered the first computer programmer -- foresaw the machine's capability to go beyond simple calculations 
    to perform any operation that could be described algorithmically.</p>
